I'm a Full Stack Developer doing meaningful projects to help people and myself through my vast coding journey! Web development/serverside has and always will have a special place in my heart. I love being graphical and programmatical. It gives me a sense of fulfilment to create beautiful projects that not only work well but are visually pleasing.
